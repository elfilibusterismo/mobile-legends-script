      "content": "I really recommend this injector because it's so very convenient and easy to use. 4 stars because not like Lesley Aspirants and Lunox Legend skin is full voice line but why Kagura's Beyond The Clouds and Exorcist skin are not full voice line? I will give this 5 stars if they add or make it a whole voice line to those skin but for now it's 4/5. I hope you add more voice line to those skins I mentioned Thankyou and god bless \ud83d\ude0a\ud83e\udd70",
