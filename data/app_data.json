      "content": "My first problem is, the Obsidian blade recall of Alucard, I cannot inject it into the default recall, instead, it injects into a wrong recall. The second, I'm not satisfied that default skins are more detailed than upgrade skins. I always use a skin of a hero because it has extra attributes. The last one is the notification preparation, it never works. These are only my problems, please fix these and I'll rate 5 stars to satisfy me and the other users and to improve your app.",
