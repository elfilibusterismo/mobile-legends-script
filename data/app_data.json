This is probably one of the best injector I've use since it actually works on my phone since I don't like using shizuku because other injector apps is now upgrading to android 13+ Which left us behind. But I have some issues other skins effect feels like they're put into smooth effects and some skins doesn't have their skin icons I'm not being ungrateful but it just feels icky specially for the expensive skins!",
