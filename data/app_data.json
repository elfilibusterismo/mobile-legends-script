      "content": "this is a very good app to inject the skins you want but there are some bugs which causes most of the effects of the skins to disappear or affect other skins that you did not inject, you cannot also change it back to its orginal skin when i uploaded the general kai skin on liquid flame i wanted to put it back to its original look but could not because the kai skin affected other skins making them look bugged overall it is good but has some bugs that makes some of it look weird",
